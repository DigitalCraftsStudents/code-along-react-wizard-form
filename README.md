# Wizard form:

- create a form for editing 3 attributes:
    - name
    - occupation
    - house
- when the form is submitted, save that to an array...somewhere?
    - confirm the new wizard is in the array by:
        - console.log()
        - maybe list them out?
        - or just use the inspector
- when do we need useEffect?
    - if we want to edit, which...we do!

## Steps! (aka built-in activities aka times when Chris gets more coffee)

- [ ] Create a WizardForm.jsx
    - fill out the basics (an import, a function, an export)
